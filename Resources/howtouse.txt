HOW TO USE
1. Dialogue.json
2. Story.json



2. Story.json
This system uses actions, each run one after the other.
To create an action, there's a specific patter you have to follow.
Inside the "story" category you can create your actions. Here's the pattern

"ActionName#":[
    "ParameterText",
    ParameterNum
]

The number of parameters varies based on the specific action.
- ActionName# refers to the name of the action to run followed by a number* ex: "Talk1" * The # must be different every time and does not detemine the order.
- If your action needs a text, you can use quotation marks with any text you want inside. Ex: "Hello, it's me!"
- If your action needs a number, you can just type your number without quotation marks.


Please note that between each action and/or parameters, you need a , (comma) to separate them
Ex: 
"Talk1":[
    "me",
    1,
    2
],
"Wait2":[
    1
]

Here are the current actions available and their required parameters

Talk - Displays a dialogue
    - Text: Who is saying the dialogue (characters id in dialogue.json)
    - Number: The PartID, what part is the dialogue in
    - Number: The TextID, what text to use from the characters
